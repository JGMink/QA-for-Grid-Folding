# 🧬 Lattice Protein Folding — Simulated & Hybrid Annealing Demo

A small-scale demo showing how **Simulated Annealing (SA)** and **Hybrid Annealing (HA)** can solve simplified **protein folding problems** on a 3D lattice — inspired by the paper:

## 🌱 What This Project Does

Proteins naturally fold into 3D shapes that minimize their internal energy — a process that’s incredibly complex to simulate.  
This project recreates that process *in miniature*, using a **tiny 3D lattice** and a simplified **3-letter amino acid alphabet**:

| Letter | Type | Effect on Energy |
|:------:|:------|:----------------|
| **H** | Hydrophobic | Favors contact with other H’s |
| **P** | Polar | Neutral interactions |
| **C** | Charged | Penalized for adjacent charged pairs |

Each “protein” chain has 6 residues placed in a **2×3×1 grid**, forming a linear chain that folds according to energy rules.  
We then use **Simulated Annealing** (and optionally **Hybrid Annealing**) to find the lowest-energy configuration.

## 🔍 Why It’s Cool

- 🧊 Demonstrates **optimization in high-dimensional search spaces**  
- 🧠 Bridges classical and quantum-inspired approaches (SA ↔ HA)  
- 🔬 Makes real protein folding ideas understandable on a toy scale  
- ⏱️ Tracks energy changes, temperature schedules, and time per run

## ⚙️ How It Works

Each run:
1. Randomly generates a sequence (e.g. `HPCPHC`)
2. Places residues in a 2×3×1 lattice
3. Computes total energy  
   \[
   E = E_{MJ} + λ_1E_1 + λ_2E_2 + λ_3E_3
   \]
4. Iteratively improves it using **Simulated Annealing**:
   - Randomly swaps or moves residues  
   - Accepts worse states probabilistically (temperature-dependent)
5. Optionally validates against **brute-force enumeration (256 configs)**

Graph output (via Matplotlib) shows energy vs temperature and the best configuration found.

## 💡 Methods and Background

This implementation borrows the general energy formulation from **Irbäck et al. (2025)**, which introduces lattice folding on minimal surfaces, and adapts it to a simpler 3-letter system for clarity.

## 🧪 Getting Started

### Requirements
```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib
```
### Run
```bash
  # Simulated Annealing (legacy entrypoint preserved)
  python3 simulated_annealing.py

  # Hybrid Annealing (legacy entrypoint preserved)
  python3 hybrid_annealing.py
```
### 🔧 Configuration

You can tweak parameters in config.py or at the top of main.py:

TEMPERATURE_STEPS: number of temperature levels (default: 25)

SWEEPS_PER_TEMP: number of iterations per temperature

ALPHA: cooling rate for geometric schedule

SEQUENCE: choose your protein sequence (e.g., HPCPHC, HHPPCC, etc.)

These allow quick experimentation with annealing depth, chain type, and cooling behavior.

### 📊 Visualization

After each run the program writes plots to the `plots/` directory with subfolders
for each method:

- `plots/sa/` — simulated annealing outputs
- `plots/ha/` — hybrid annealing outputs

You can enable live plotting during execution by setting:
```python
LIVE_PLOT = True
```

### 🧩 Example Experiments

Try adjusting the parameters to see how annealing affects convergence:

| Experiment | Description | Expected Behavior |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `ALPHA = 0.95` | Slow cooling | More thorough exploration, slower runtime |
| `ALPHA = 0.70` | Fast cooling | Quicker but more likely to get stuck |
| `SWEEPS_PER_TEMP = 1000` | Longer per step | Better convergence for small systems |
| `SEQUENCE = 'HCHCHC'` | Alternating charges | Higher penalties, more complex landscape |

## 🏡 House-Keeping

### 🧠 What’s Next

- Add true Hybrid Annealing integration (mixing classical + quantum subroutines)

- Visualize 3D lattice states with matplotlib or PyVista

- Extend to larger lattice (3×3×3) and more complex alphabets (HP or HP+C variants)
